With views fit for a king, the trail, leading to the lake region i.e. from the city of Mandi to the little village of Baggi, become private and exclusive to every group that visits. It is of prime importance to remain hydrated and careful during every part of the journey owing to unpredictable, slippery paths and the formation of ice on the surfaces. The setting of the campsite in Prashar Lake location is yet another pleasant surprise because of its closeness to the water and its harmony with nature."

          "value": "Prashar Lake trek (2,730m), which happily takes people to the lake which is completely frozen in the winter and a dazzling beauty otherwise, is considered to be an important trek in Himachal Pradesh. The picture-perfect blue water lake is surrounded by the majestic Dhauladhar Ranges in Kullu Valley and it is always kept as a secret in the Mandi district of Himachal Pradesh. If you set out for a trek to Prashar Lake, you will be going through the charming trails crossing the forests and several small streams. \nAs you climb the trails up, you will come to meet the local people and it is the best chance to know the indigenous culture closely. Also, once you finish the trek, you will have the satisfied heart filled with plenty of beautiful views of Dhauladhar, Pir Panjal and Kinnaur mountain ranges.\nAlongside, there is a surprisingly beautiful attraction near the lake that is the local temple of Prashar Rishi which has a lot of significant architectural brilliance carved on the walls. The style perfectly matches with the landscape around the lake and thus it is a favourite tourist attraction in the region. If you're in the mood for some outdoor adventure and want these memories to be etched forever, then make Prashar Lake the destination of your choice!"
