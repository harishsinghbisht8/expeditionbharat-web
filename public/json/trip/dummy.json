Streams of crystal-clear rivers formed by the melting of glaciers, lush green meadows, hamlets, pine forests and rugged terrain form the varied topography of this region. But it is perhaps the mythological aspect of the Har ki Doon trek that makes this onerous journey more special. It would be a heavenly experience to trek along the “Valley of Gods”, and follow the track once beaten by Pandavas on their way to the heavens. So how closer you come to heavens is quite impossible to say, but the panorama of the gorgeous settings amid the snow clad peaks would be no less than a divine experience."

The valley is clad with snow from October through March and one would hardly find anything other than alpine vegetation growing in this region.  Since this course is comparatively less vigorous, it would be a great way to begin your trekking experience with Har ki Doon trek this season. The extravagance of nature in the form of rich variety of flora and fauna is worth capturing and a high definition camera would always come handy for this purpose."
