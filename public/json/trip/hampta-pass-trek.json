          "value": "A quintessential trek for first-timers,the Hampta Pass trek is tailor made for those looking to experience the Himalayan adventures! The easiest access point for this trek is from Manali at an altitude of 14,100 ft, unlike most treks that start from a remote village.\nHampta Pass trekking is appealing mostly due to the fact that it connects the beautiful valleys of Kullu and Lahaul. The awe-inspiring landscapes and natural foliage of the region itself draws trekkers aplenty, not to mention the abundance of rare Himalayan birds and orchids spotted here.\nFlourished with thick alpine forests, sprawling meadows, glacial valleys, this trek packs the punch of an idyllic adventure in the Himalayas. Moreover, trailing up to Hampta Pass also involves crossing through the high altitude alpine lake, reputed for its deep blue colour, called Chandratal. Another exemplary feature is the passage through the captivating Rohtang Pass that stands at an altitude of 13,000 feet and is enveloped in snow throughout the year, The best time to visit is in July to August."

You can also find other types of trees such as maple, cedar, toss and\noak. The sight is fresh, the sloping slope is not an easy and very vertical. Either\nway you have reached Chika which is at the end of the vast grass, but it is a\nbetter and easier way to climb the hill and reach Chika. The Chika camp site is a\nhuge green patch. Tonight you will be in the camp, and the campfire will stay in\nthe night if you get dry wood."

The climb is all the way\nfrom Hampton. As you cross, you enter Lahaul region and the change in scenes\nis very the opposite. The path is completely downhill from the pass. After some\nwalk you will be able to see the “Shia Gohru” camping site in the direction of the\nflow of the river. Here you have to cross the river which is very cold. This river\nis born from Hamta Glacier. After crossing this river you will reach the camp. It\nwill be the coldest night in the camp"
