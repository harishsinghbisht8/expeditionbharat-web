          "value": "A quintessential trek for first-timers,the Hampta Pass trek is tailor made for those looking to experience the Himalayan adventures! The easiest access point for this trek is from Manali at an altitude of 14,100 ft, unlike most treks that start from a remote village.\nHampta Pass trekking is appealing mostly due to the fact that it connects the beautiful valleys of Kullu and Lahaul. The awe-inspiring landscapes and natural foliage of the region itself draws trekkers aplenty, not to mention the abundance of rare Himalayan birds and orchids spotted here.\nFlourished with thick alpine forests, sprawling meadows, glacial valleys, this trek packs the punch of an idyllic adventure in the Himalayas. Moreover, trailing up to Hampta Pass also involves crossing through the high altitude alpine lake, reputed for its deep blue colour, called Chandratal. Another exemplary feature is the passage through the captivating Rohtang Pass that stands at an altitude of 13,000 feet and is enveloped in snow throughout the year, The best time to visit is in July to August."
