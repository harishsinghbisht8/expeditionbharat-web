The exciting trek starts after you reach Haridwar from where you will be going to Sari passing by the views of the Ganga and Alakananda Rivers and the pilgrim centres of Rishikesh, Devprayag and Rudraprayag will surely let you feel holy. The Mandakini valley you come across before reaching Kund would have many surprises prior to you settling down near the river at the campsite at Sari.\nA very enthusiastic yet moderate trek to Deoria Tal may let you witness the quaint hamlets and the temple of Ukhimath and later you need to cross many thickets enriched by the presence of abundant bird species and gradual ascents. Deoria Tal will never disappoint you in terms of the camping and the views from the lake. Chopta fills the post of upcoming destination during the trek. To arrive Chopta, one will have to conquer the not so friendly rhododendron forests.\nTungnath Temple and Chandrashila Peak located at a height of about 4000 meters will be calling you to reach them after beholding the mesmerizing views of hued meadows and pastures. From the top of Chandrashila, get enchanted by the peaks of Nanda Devi, Trishul, Chaukhamba. Following by the time at the peak top, return journey to Haridwar will be ready."
